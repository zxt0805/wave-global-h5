      <h2>7. KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE</h2>
      <p>
        We encourage you to contact us as soon as possible to enable us to update any Personal Data we have about you.
        Incomplete or outdated Personal Data may result in our inability to provide, or delays in providing you with
        products and services you have requested, or processing any requests and applications you may have made to us.
      </p>
      <h2>8. RETENTION</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your information only for the duration we need to provide you with the services and to fulfil the
        purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This is also the case for third-parties to whom we share your
        information with and who carries out services on our behalf. Your information will be retained as is reasonably
        necessary for our business and to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations. Where your data is no longer
        needed, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalise it so that we cannot identify you.
      </p>
      <h2>9. DATA SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        9.1 We will take reasonable efforts to protect Personal Data in our possession or under our control by making
        reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
        modification, disposal or similar risks, as well as the loss of any storage medium or device on which Personal
        Data is stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.2 We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure
        Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be
        accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the
        information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers,
        financials, etc.) is never kept on file.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.3 However, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any Personal Data we may have collected from or
        about you, or that for example no harmful code will enter our website. You should be aware of the risks
        associated with using websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.4 We cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us via the Internet, and we urge you to
        take every precaution to protect your Personal Data when you use our platforms. We recommend that you change
        your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and ensure that you use a secure browser..

      <h2>10. USE OF COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
      <p>
        10.1 You acknowledge and agree that our websites and platforms may include analytics code and other tools that
        may allow us to gather information on any use of any of our websites and platforms, and may include our use of
        cookies, running of verification and compliance analysis and/or use of data capture, syndication analysis,
        and/or other similar tools to track, extract, compile, aggregate, archive, disclose or otherwise analyse any
        data and/or information resulting from any person&apos;s access to and/or use of any of our websites and
        platforms, and further that: (a) we shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to all such gathered
        information and data; (b) you shall not disable or interfere with any such analytics code and tools; and (c) any
        intellectual property rights of or in the results of such analytics shall vest solely in us. For the avoidance
        of doubt, we may monitor, track and share with third parties your geo-location information obtained by any of
        our websites and platforms for safety, security, technical, marketing and commercial purposes, including to
        provide and improve our products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.2 For example, our websites and platforms may use cookies and other technologies. In this regard:
        <br /> <br />• (a) Cookies are small text files stored in your computing or other electronic devices when you
        visit our website and platforms for record keeping purposes. Cookies are stored in your browser&apos;s file
        directory, and the next time you visit the website or platform, your browser will read the cookie and relay the
        information back to the website, platform or element that originally set the cookie. Depending on the type of
        cookie it is, cookies may store user preferences and other information.
        <br /> <br />• (b) Web beacons (also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) involve graphics that are not apparent
        to the user. Tracking links and/or similar technologies consist of a few lines of programming code and can be
        embedded in our websites or platforms. Web beacons are usually used in conjunction with cookies and primarily
        used for statistical analysis purposes. This technology can also be used for tracking traffic patterns on
        websites and platforms, as well as finding out if an e-mail has been received and opened and to see if there has
        been any response.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.3 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may employ cookies and other technologies as follows:
        <br /> <br />• (a) tracking information such as the number of visitors and their frequency of use, profiles of
        visitors and their preferred sites;
        <br /> <br />• (b) making our websites and platforms easier to use. For example, cookies may be used to help
        speed up your future interactions with our websites and platforms;
        <br /> <br />• (c) to better tailor our products and services to your interests and needs. For example, cookies
        information may be identified and disclosed to our vendors and business partners to generate consumer insights;
        <br /> <br />• (d) collating information on a user&apos;s search and browsing history;
        <br /> <br />• (e) when you interact with us on our websites and platforms, we may automatically receive and
        record information on our server logs from your browser. We may collect for the purposes of analysis,
        statistical and site-related information including, without limitation, information relating to how a visitor
        arrived at the website or platform, the browser used by a visitor, the operating system a visitor is using, a
        visitor&apos;s IP address, and a visitor&apos;s click stream information and time stamp (which may include for
        example, information about which pages they have viewed, the time the pages were accessed and the time spent per
        web page, your searches for hotels or experiences, bookings you have made, and other actions);
        <br /> <br />• (f) using such information to understand how people use our websites and platforms, and to help
        us improve their structure and contents;
        <br /> <br />• (g) using cookies that are necessary in order to enable our websites and platforms to operate,
        for example, cookies that enable you to log onto secure parts of our websites and platforms; and/or
        <br /> <br />• (h) personalising the website and platform for you, including delivering advertisements which may
        be of particular interest to you and using cookie related information to allow us to understand the
        effectiveness of our advertisements.

      <p>
        10.4 We may also collect information about your precise or approximate location as determined through data such
        as your IP address or mobile device&apos;s GPS to offer you an improved user experience. Most mobile devices
        allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device&apos;s settings
        menu. Wave App may also collect this information even when you are not using the app if this connection is
        enabled through your settings or device permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.5 Some cookies we use are from third party companies to provide us with web analytics and intelligence about
        our websites and platforms. These companies collect information about your interaction with our websites and
        platforms. We use such information to compile statistics about visitors who interact with the websites,
        platforms and other Wave App online content, to gauge the effectiveness of our communications, and to provide
        more pertinent information to our visitors.
      </p>
